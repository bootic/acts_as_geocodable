Description:
  The geocodable migration generator creates a migration which you can use to generate two tables:

    geocodes - Contains the latitude and longitude coordinates, with the address they refer to.
    geocodings - The polymorphic join table.


Example:
    rails generate acts_as_geocodable

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an AddGeocodableTables migration in the
    file db/migrate/5_add_geocodable_tables.rb
